#  Electronics Store Support Chatbot

Welcome! This project is a smart chatbot designed to help users with questions about electronics—like smartphones, laptops, order tracking, return policies, payment methods, and warranties.

It uses **AI-powered search and text generation** to provide helpful and conversational answers, just like a human support agent would.

##  What This Chatbot Can Do

* Answer questions in natural language
* Understand the intent behind your query using semantic search
* Pull up relevant answers from a list of FAQs
* Generate human-like responses using GPT-2
* Provide a clean and simple web interface (thanks to Gradio)

##  Built With

* **Gradio** – To create the interactive chat interface
* **FAISS** – To quickly find the most relevant FAQ entries
* **Sentence Transformers** – For turning questions into vectors (embeddings)
* **GPT-2** – For generating detailed answers in natural language
* **PyTorch** – For running the GPT-2 model under the hood

##  How It Works (In Plain English)

1. We start with a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs).
2. When a user types a question, the chatbot finds the most similar questions from the list using a model called `MiniLM`.
3. It then combines those answers to build a "context" for GPT-2.
4. GPT-2 uses that context to generate a custom, fluent answer.
5. The answer is shown in the web interface!
